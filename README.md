# DrinkingWaterARApp

Drinking Water AR application displays information on drinking water accessibility and the environmentally sustainable use of water bottles rather than plastic cups. The application can be used to locate drinking water related information by simply pointing the device camera towards a point of interest (POI). Also, it can be used to file and view water-related complaints. Thus, the application helps users to conveniently identify drinking water related information inside AU, thus providing easy access to clean drinking water.

The water AR application is developed in android studio using Java programming language, and libraries such as Google’s ARCore, Google’s FireBase and ARCoreLocation by APPoly.
